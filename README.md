# Indian-Food-Dashboard

Good day everyone, in my previous post, I mentioned that I had embarked on a journey to learn Excel, and I shared a project that I had worked on using this software. I am delighted to present another project I have completed using Excel. This project revolves around the "Indian Food Dataset," which I obtained from Kaggle. The dataset originates from a restaurant in India, and I'd like to share some key insights that I've extracted from it.
Insights:
ðŸ“Œ         The typical preparation time for each dish in the restaurant averages around 28.59 minutes.
ðŸ“Œ         The typical cooking time for each dish in the restaurant averages around 30.83 minutes.
ðŸ“Œ         The overall average preparation time for food in this restaurant is approximately 59.42 minutes.
ðŸ“Œ         For the Diet column, the average cooking time for vegan and non-vegetarian dishes is significantly longer.
ðŸ“Œ         For the Diet meal, the average preparation time for gluten-free dishes is significantly longer.
ðŸ“Œ         For the course meal, the cooking time for Dessert dishes is significantly longer on average.
ðŸ“Œ         For the course meal, the preparation time for High Protein dishes is significantly longer on average.
ðŸ“Œ         For the cuisine meal, the preparation time for Nepalese dishes is significantly longer on average.
ðŸ“Œ         For the course meal, the cooking time for Dessert dishes is significantly longer on average.
ðŸ“Œ         On average, Parsi cuisine meals tend to have the highest serving numbers.
ðŸ“Œ         Vegetarian course meals, on average, tend to have the highest serving numbers.
ðŸ“Œ         Individuals with no preference for onion in their diet tend to have the highest serving numbers.
Actionable Strategies / Recommendations:
ðŸ“Œ         The restaurant should consider optimizing cooking processes or recipes for dishes with longer preparation and cooking times to improve kitchen efficiency.
ðŸ“Œ         They should also consider highlighting to customers any dishes that are prepared quickly, as they can be a good choice for those in a hurry.
ðŸ“Œ         They should also monitor and manage the overall kitchen workflow to ensure that orders are prepared within a reasonable time frame. And also explore ways to streamline cooking processes for faster service.
ðŸ“Œ         They should review the menu to see if there are opportunities to reduce cooking times for vegan and non-vegetarian dishes without compromising quality.
ðŸ“Œ         They should consider expanding the selection of gluten-free dishes to cater to dietary preferences.
ðŸ“Œ         They should assess the recipes and cooking methods for Nepalese dishes to identify areas where preparation time can be reduced.
ðŸ“Œ        They should explore the possibility of offering a wider variety of Parsi cuisine meals, as they tend to have higher serving numbers.
